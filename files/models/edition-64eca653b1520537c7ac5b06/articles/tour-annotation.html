<h1>Annotation Labels</h1><p>The annotation icon (include icon) enables the annotations with short descriptive text attached to specific locations on the model. Some annotations have a 'read more' link that will open an associated article. The annotations for this viewer are subdivided into three groups and can be toggled on and off via the annotations panel at the bottom of the 3D viewer.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><img src="Media/annotations.gif">
