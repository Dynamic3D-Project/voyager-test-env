As the Sherwood Foresters approached, Malone took up position in a third floor bathroom window. Armed with a Mauser automatic pistol that was modified with a rifle stock (nicknamed a ‘Peter the Painter’) Malone was responsible for many &nbsp;of the casualties inflicted upon the British during the early stages of the battle.</p><p>His vantage point gave him many targets from behind effective cover including the easily identifiable officers and especially those who tried to flank the side of the building. These unsuccessful charges stalled the Sherwood Foresters advance, buying Malone, Grace, and any other Irish Volunteers in firing range more time to inflict casualties.&nbsp;</p><p>(Papadopoulos &amp; Schreibman, 2022)</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
