<h1>Interactive Guided Tours</h1><p><img src="Media/tours.png" width="20" style="float:left" hspace="10px"> The tour icon enables a list of ‘tours’. A tour is a curated pathway through the content.&nbsp;Tours will appear on the top left. Once you select a tour, a panel will appear at the bottom of the viewer with arrows to take you through the tour’s stages.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="Media/tour_panel.png"></p><p>Tours incorporate articles <img src="Media/articles.png" width="20" hspace="5px">, annotations <img src="Media/annotations.png" width="20" hspace="5px"> and camera movements around the 3D model. There is a logical order of the tours but you are also able to explore via articles (not incorporated into tours)&nbsp;or via annotations on the model itself.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
