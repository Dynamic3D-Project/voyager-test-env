In anticipation of the British response, they positioned men on the main roads leading to the city centre so as to block or at least impede the British advance.</p><p>One such position was taken up by Lieutenant Michael Malone from C Company who positioned his men in four buildings along Northumberland Road just south of Mount Street Bridge: 25 Northumberland Road, St. Stephen's Parochial Hall, St. Stephen's Parochial School (evacuated on Tuesday as the position could not observe or fire on the main anticipated British route of advance), and Clanwilliam House. C Company was part of Éamon de Valera’s 3rd Battalion of the Irish Volunteers.</p><p>Although a British response was expected by the Irish Volunteers, there was no indication as to where it would come from. As soon as Malone’s force of C Company had taken their positions, communication was difficult and came when relatives visited with resupplies or when news was called out from the street.</p><p>(MAI, BMH WS 310, 1949)</p><p><audio controls=""><source src="Media/LUCA_Positioning_of_C_Company.wav" type="audio/wav">Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio></p>
